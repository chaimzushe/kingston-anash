# Fixing the useSearchParams() Error in Next.js

This document explains how to fix the error: "useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary".

## Understanding the Issue

The error occurs because:

1. The `useSearchParams()` hook in Next.js requires a Suspense boundary
2. This is a requirement in Next.js for certain hooks that might cause client-side rendering bailout
3. Without a Suspense boundary, the build process fails with the error message

## The Fix

I've updated the `/app/auth/error/page.tsx` file to wrap the component using `useSearchParams()` in a Suspense boundary:

1. Split the component into two parts:
   - `AuthErrorContent`: The inner component that uses `useSearchParams()`
   - `AuthError`: The main component that wraps `AuthErrorContent` in a Suspense boundary

2. Added a loading fallback UI that shows while the search params are being loaded

3. Imported the `Suspense` component from React

## Code Changes

Here's a summary of the changes made:

```tsx
// Before
export default function AuthError() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  // Rest of the component...
}

// After
// Component that uses useSearchParams must be wrapped in Suspense
function AuthErrorContent() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  // Rest of the component...
}

// Main component with Suspense boundary
export default function AuthError() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={/* Loading UI */}>
      <AuthErrorContent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

## Additional Case Sensitivity Fix

We also fixed a case sensitivity issue with the Navigation component import:

```tsx
// Before (incorrect)
import Navigation from "../components/navigation";

// After (correct)
import Navigation from "../components/Navigation";
```

This is important because some deployment environments (like Vercel) are case-sensitive with file paths, even if your local development environment is not.

## Why This Matters

1. **Build Process**: Without this fix, the build process fails, preventing deployment
2. **Server Components**: Next.js has specific requirements for hooks in server components
3. **Performance**: Proper Suspense boundaries improve the loading experience

## When to Use Suspense with Hooks

In Next.js, you should wrap components in Suspense when using these hooks:

- `useSearchParams()`
- `usePathname()`
- `useRouter()`
- Any other hook that might cause a client-side rendering bailout

## Testing the Fix

After making these changes, the build process should complete successfully. You can verify this by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you encounter any other similar errors, apply the same pattern: wrap the component using the hook in a Suspense boundary.
